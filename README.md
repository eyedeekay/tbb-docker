# Dockerized Tor Browser Bundle

This is a set of Docker containers, one which runs Tor with a SocksPort,
ControlPort, and Cookie-based authentication, the other which runs a Tor Browser
Bundle configured to use the Tor-hosting docker container. This is an entirely
unofficial effort with no endorsement or guarantee from anyone, least of all
a reputable organization like the Tor Project.

## TL:DR

        make browse
